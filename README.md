# Standalone-Open-Source-Bot
A free standalone open source bot for Minecraft 1.12.2. The bot has has a multitude of fun commands as well more planned in the future!
## How to Use:
* There are two main folder for you to use in the .minecraft folder which are called "Stats" and "Misc". In the stats folder you will find .jsons with the stats of every player your bot has interacted with. In the misc folder you will find the Config.json which is used to change aspects of the bot. (Think of it as your settings)
* If you wish to change the name of the bot from the default (Gerald + Bot) then you can do that by going to "Config.json" in the "Misc" folder and change the BotName setting to whatever word you like for your bot. Just remember whatever you put here is gonna have Bot added to the end of it in use. If you need for these changes to take effect after you are already in game, you can do that by using the G_reload command in chat.
## Future Plans?
* Add Webhook support for custom links, along with sending chats to that webhook.
* Add more game commands.
